## Projects and Contributions
Basic Ones:
- Hand and Pose Tracking Models: I have worked on developing hand and pose tracking models. These models utilize computer vision techniques to track and recognize hand movements or human poses in images or videos.

- Front End Development: I have experience as a front end developer. I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. One of my notable projects is:

  - Chess Game using JavaScript: I have developed a chess game using JavaScript. It provides an interactive interface for users to play chess against the computer or with another player.
 
#### Note : There aren't much projects which I can disclose, my excellence in Deep Learning and Computer Vision is visible by my internship at Bolt IoT and my work in Data Analysis and Full Stack Development is proved by my current employment at Fischer Jordan. Most of the work available on my github was from the time when I was learning that skills during 2021-2023.

## Hobbies

- Pencil Sketching: I have a passion for pencil sketching and enjoy creating artistic drawings. It allows me to express my creativity and capture the beauty of the world around me.

- Piano Playing: Playing the piano is another hobby of mine. I find joy in exploring various melodies and expressing emotions through music. It is a wonderful way to relax and unwind.
